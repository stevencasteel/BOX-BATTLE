║   ▒  Hit-Stop / Hit-Freeze: A micro-pause (e.g., 0.05 seconds) of the entire ║
║      game simulation when a high-impact melee hit connects. This adds a      ║
║      feeling of weight and power to attacks.                                 ║

║   ▒  Attack-Interrupting Windows: Specific boss telegraph animations could   ║
║      have a brief "vulnerable" window. Landing a hit during this window      ║
║      would interrupt the boss's attack and potentially trigger a mini-stun.  ║
║                                                                              ║
║   ▒  Cinematic Phase Transitions: When the boss's health crosses a threshold,║
║      it could enter a brief, invulnerable `PhaseChange` state, play a unique ║
║      animation or visual effect, and then resume combat with its new attack  ║
║      patterns. This makes the phase shifts feel like significant events.     ║
║                                                                              ║
║   ▒  Enhanced Stun Feedback: As the boss's stun meter fills, provide clear   ║
║      feedback to the player. This could include a subtle vignette effect, a  ║
║      pulsing glow on the boss, or a rising audio cue that indicates a stun   ║
║      is imminent.                                                            ║

║   ▒  Diagnostics Singleton: A dedicated global service for logging important ║
║      but non-crashing gameplay events. For example, it could record every    ║

║      is ignored due to invincibility. This would create a detailed log to help║
