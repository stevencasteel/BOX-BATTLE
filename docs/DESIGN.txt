║   █  Sublime Movement by Default: The player is given a complete, perfected, ║
║      and expressive moveset from the beginning. The joy of the game comes    ║
║      from mastering these tools, not from unlocking them.                    ║

║   █  Aesthetic Minimalism, Technical Maximalism: The visual style will be    ║
║      clean, minimalist, and beautiful, inspired by high-end web design       ║
║      (e.g., Framer websites). We will use advanced shaders, procedural       ║
║      generation, and particle effects to create a polished, "expensive"      ║
║      look with elements like frosted glass, backlighting, and subtle gradients.║

║   █  Robust, Maintainable Code: Development will adhere to the SOLID principles║
║      (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, etc.) to ensure the codebase is    ║
║      scalable, easy to debug, and a pleasure to work on. We refactor first.  ║

║      ░ ■ Wall-Sliding and Wall-Jumping for verticality.                      ║

║      ░ ■ Primary Melee: A fast, close-range attack.                          ║
║      ░ ■ Charged Shot: A long-range projectile attack.                       ║
║      ░ ■ Pogo Attack: A downward aerial attack that bounces on enemies.      ║
║      ░ ■ Dash Invincibility: The player cannot take damage during a dash.    ║
║                                                                              ║

║      ░ ■ Enhanced Melee Hitbox: The melee swing will have two hitboxes. The  ║
║      ░   inner box (close to the player) will deal 1.5x damage, rewarding    ║
║      ░   risky positioning. The outer box will deal 1.0x damage.             ║
║      ░ ■ Input Buffering: Attack and dash inputs will be buffered just like  ║
║      ░   the jump input, making the controls feel more responsive.           ║
║      ░ ■ Pogo-Fall Prevention: A brief window after a pogo will prevent      ║

║   ▓  Health and Healing: The Determination System                            ║
║      ░  Healing is a resource earned by dealing damage. Landing hits fills a ║
║      ░  `determination_counter` to grant a `healing_charge`.                 ║
║                                                                              ║

║      ░    no damage, punctuated by moments of vulnerability.                 ║
║      ░  ■ Clear Telegraphing: All attacks will be preceded by clear visual/audio║
