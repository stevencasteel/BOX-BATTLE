║   □  [BUG-F006] Significant stutter/hitch occurred on arena load.            ║
║      ░  FIXED: 2025-08-06                                                    ║
║      ░  SOLUTION: Replaced the synchronous, blocking level generation with a ║
║      ░  new asynchronous system in `ArenaBuilder.gd`. The `build_level_async`║
║      ░  function now creates the level in batches, using `await` to yield    ║
║      ░  control back to the engine between batches. This prevents the main   ║
║      ░  thread from freezing, resulting in a smooth loading sequence.        ║
║                                                                              ║
║   □  [BUG-F005] Player death caused a black screen instead of reloading.     ║
║      ░  FIXED: 2025-08-06                                                    ║
║      ░  SOLUTION: The `game.gd` script was made robust to handle both        ║
║      ░  initial loads (using the pre-built level from `GameManager`) and     ║
║      ░  reloads (by calling `ArenaBuilder.build_level()` as a fallback).     ║
║                                                                              ║
║   □  [BUG-F004] Standard melee attacks did not destroy enemy projectiles.    ║
║      ░  FIXED: 2025-08-06                                                    ║
║      ░  SOLUTION: The `_on_hitbox_area_entered` function logic was           ║
║      ░  corrected to handle non-pogo attack collisions with projectiles,     ║
║      ░  allowing forward and upward swings to destroy them.                  ║
║                                                                              ║
║   □  [BUG-F003] Drop-through platforms ("-") were not functioning.           ║
║      ░  FIXED: 2025-08-06                                                    ║
║      ░  SOLUTION: Re-implemented the Down+Jump logic in the player's         ║
║      ░  `state_move` function. Corrected the platform's collision shape      ║
║      ░  position and group assignment in `game.gd`.                          ║
║                                                                              ║
║   □  [BUG-F002] Player pogo attack was not working correctly on all surfaces.║
║      ░  FIXED: 2025-08-05                                                    ║
║      ░  SOLUTION: Re-implemented the `_check_for_immediate_pogo()` physics   ║
║      ░  query to allow instant bounces on surfaces directly below the        ║
║      ░  player. Updated the `_trigger_pogo()` function to correctly handle   ║
║      ░  bouncing on enemy projectiles in addition to standard enemies.       ║
║                                                                              ║
║   □  [BUG-F001] Player was not taking contact damage from boss/hazards.      ║
║      ░  FIXED: 2025-08-05                                                    ║
║      ░  SOLUTION: During the state machine refactor, the player's            ║
║      ░  `CharacterBody2D` `collision_mask` was changed to ignore the         ║
║      ░  "enemy" and "hazard" layers. The mask was updated in `player.tscn`   ║
║      ░  to correctly detect these layers again, allowing the existing        ║
║      ░  `_check_for_contact_damage()` function to work as intended.          ║
║                                                                              ║
