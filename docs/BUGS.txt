║   □  [BUG-F007] Intermittent major hitch on first run or debug mode toggle.  ║
║      ░  FIXED: 2025-08-07                                                    ║
║      ░  SOLUTION: Implemented a shader pre-warming system in `LoadingScreen`.║
║      ░  An off-screen `SubViewport` is used to instantiate key entities      ║
║      ░  (Player, Boss, Projectiles) for a single frame, which forces the     ║
║      ░  engine to compile their shaders before they are needed in the main   ║
║      ░  game scene. This eliminates the first-appearance stutter.            ║
║                                                                              ║
║   □  [BUG-F006] Significant stutter/hitch occurred on arena load.            ║
║      ░  FIXED: 2025-08-07                                                    ║
║      ░  SOLUTION: Replaced the synchronous, blocking level generation with a ║
║      ░  new asynchronous system in `ArenaBuilder.gd`. The `build_level_async`║
║      ░  function now creates the level in batches, using `await` to yield    ║
║      ░  control back to the engine between batches. This prevents the main   ║
║      ░  thread from freezing, resulting in a smooth loading sequence managed ║
║      ░  by a new `LoadingScreen`.                                            ║
║                                                                              ║
║   □  [BUG-F005] Player death caused a physics crash.                         ║
║      ░  FIXED: 2025-08-07                                                    ║
║      ░  SOLUTION: Scene changes in `game.gd`'s `_on_player_died` and         ║
║      ░  `_on_boss_died` functions were changed to `get_tree().call_deferred()`.║
║      ░  This prevents the engine from trying to delete a physics body while  ║
║      ░  it is still processing a physics callback.                           ║
║                                                                              ║
║   □  [BUG-F004] Hazard tiles did not deal contact damage.                    ║
║      ░  FIXED: 2025-08-07                                                    ║
║      ░  SOLUTION: Corrected the implementation in `ArenaBuilder.gd`. The     ║
║      ░  `_create_hazard_tile` function now creates a single `StaticBody2D`   ║
║      ░  that exists on both the "world" and "hazard" collision layers and is ║
║      ░  part of both corresponding groups, ensuring it's both solid and damaging.║
║                                                                              ║
║   □  [BUG-F003] Drop-through platforms ("-") were not functioning.           ║
║      ░  FIXED: 2025-08-06                                                    ║
║      ░  SOLUTION: Re-implemented the Down+Jump logic in the player's         ║
║      ░  `state_move` function. Corrected the platform's collision shape      ║
║      ░  position and group assignment in `game.gd`.                          ║
║                                                                              ║
║   □  [BUG-F002] Player pogo attack was not working correctly on all surfaces.║
║      ░  FIXED: 2025-08-05                                                    ║
║      ░  SOLUTION: Re-implemented the `_check_for_immediate_pogo()` physics   ║
║      ░  query to allow instant bounces on surfaces directly below the        ║
║      ░  player. Updated the `_trigger_pogo()` function to correctly handle   ║
║      ░  bouncing on enemy projectiles in addition to standard enemies.       ║
║                                                                              ║
║   □  [BUG-F001] Player was not taking contact damage from boss/hazards.      ║
║      ░  FIXED: 2025-08-05                                                    ║
║      ░  SOLUTION: During the state machine refactor, the player's            ║
║      ░  `CharacterBody2D` `collision_mask` was changed to ignore the         ║
║      ░  "enemy" and "hazard" layers. The mask was updated in `player.tscn`   ║
║      ░  to correctly detect these layers again, allowing the existing        ║
║      ░  `_check_for_contact_damage()` function to work as intended.          ║
║                                                                              ║

   □  [BUG-UI001] Inconsistent Back Button Centering in Sub-Menus.
      ░  STATUS: OPEN
      ░  DESCRIPTION: The "Back" button in the Sound and Controls menus is not
      ░  perfectly centered horizontally, unlike the button in the Credits menu.
      ░  This is likely due to a conflict between manual positioning and the
      ░  parent container's layout logic.
      ░  DEFERRED: A full UI overhaul is planned for a future sprint. This
      ░  minor visual bug will be resolved then.

         □  [BUG-RENDER001] Debug collision shapes are culled at viewport edges.
      ░  STATUS: OPEN
      ░  DESCRIPTION: When running with "Visible Collision Shapes", the blue
      ░  debug lines for physics bodies that fall exactly on the camera's
      ░  viewport boundary are inconsistently rendered (often missing). This
      ░  appears to be a minor engine culling artifact.
      ░  DEFERRED: This is a debug-only visual issue and has no impact on
      ░  gameplay, final visuals, or actual collision detection. It is a very
      ░  low priority fix.
