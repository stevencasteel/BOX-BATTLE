║   █  Architectural Changes                                                   ║
║      ░ ■ Refactored `ArenaBuilder` to be data-driven, reading the layout file║
║      ░   path from a constant in the encounter script, removing brittle      ║
║      ░   string manipulation logic.                                          ║
║      ░ ■ Decoupled `GlobalHUD` from specific menu scenes by making its       ║
║      ░   visibility fully event-driven (`MENU_OPENED`, `MENU_CLOSED`),       ║
║      ░   resolving an Open/Closed Principle violation.                       ║
║      ░ ■ Extracted player combat logic (firing shots, pogo attacks) from     ║
║      ░   `player.gd` into a new, focused `CombatComponent`, further applying ║
║      ░   the Single Responsibility Principle.                                ║
║      ░ ■ Refactored the monolithic `base_boss.gd` script into a component-   ║
║      ░   based architecture, adhering to SRP and mirroring the Player's design.║
║      ░ ■ Created `BossStateData.gd` resource to act as a central data        ║
║      ░   container, decoupling the boss's state from the node itself.        ║
║      ░ ■ Generalized the `HealthComponent` to be fully reusable, now managing║
║      ░   health, damage, and invincibility logic for any entity.             ║
║      ░ ■ Refactored the monolithic `player.gd` script into a component-based ║
║      ░   architecture, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.      ║
║      ░ ■ Created a `HealthComponent` to manage all health, damage, and       ║
║      ░   invincibility logic, making it reusable for other entities.         ║
║      ░ ■ Created a `PlayerStateData` resource to act as a central data       ║
║      ░   container, decoupling state from the Player node itself.            ║
║                                                                              ║
║   █  Performance                                                             ║
║      ░ ■ Implemented a robust, generic `ObjectPool` singleton to manage      ║
║      ░   reusable nodes like projectiles.                                    ║
║      ░ ■ Refactored Player and Boss to get/return projectiles from the pool, ║
║      ░   eliminating runtime instantiation to prevent GC spikes and stutter. ║
║                                                                              ║
║   █  Changed                                                                 ║
║      ░ ■ Refactored `Sequencer.gd` to use type-safe `SequenceStep` resources ║
║      ░   instead of ad-hoc dictionaries, preventing runtime errors and       ║
║      ░   improving editor autocompletion.                                    ║
║      ░ ■ Refactored `AudioManager.gd` and `GlobalHUD` to be event-driven,    ║
║      ░   subscribing to a new `audio_settings_changed` signal instead of     ║
║      ░   polling for changes every frame.                                    ║
║                                                                              ║
║   █  Fixed                                                                   ║
║      ░ ■ Fixed a visual bug where the Boss's hit-flash color would not reset ║
║      ░   correctly by ensuring the correct initialization order in `base_boss.gd`.║
║      ░ ■ Resolved an audio stream memory leak on exit by implementing a      ║
║      ░   robust cleanup handler for `NOTIFICATION_WM_CLOSE_REQUEST`.         ║
║      ░ ■ Resolved all `SHADOWED_GLOBAL_IDENTIFIER` warnings by removing      ║
║      ░   unnecessary `preload` calls for scripts with a `class_name`.        ║
║      ░ ■ Resolved a critical physics crash by redesigning the `ObjectPool` to║
║      ░   use a signal-based, non-re-parenting architecture that is immune to ║
║      ░   race conditions.                                                    ║
║      ░ ■ Resolved all memory leaks by implementing proper cleanup in         ║
║      ░   `_exit_tree` for all state machines, components, and singletons.    ║
║      ░ ■ Resolved a leak caused by creating orphaned nodes in `ArenaBuilder`.║
║      ░ ■ Corrected `Config.gd` to ensure deterministic config loading.       ║
║      ░ ■ Fixed a critical crash in the `EventBus` related to polymorphism.   ║
║      ░ ■ Resolved all remaining static analysis warnings for a clean build.  ║
║                                                                              ║
