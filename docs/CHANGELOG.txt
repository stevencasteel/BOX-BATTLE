║      ░ ■ Corrected a bug where the boss's sprite would flip independently    ║

║      ░ ■ Resolved a critical startup crash caused by improper scene changing.║
║      ░ ■ Fixed a critical bug where reloading after player death would fail. ║
║      ░ ■ Restored ability to drop through one-way platforms.                 ║
║      ░ ■ Standard melee attacks (forward/up) now correctly destroy enemy     ║
