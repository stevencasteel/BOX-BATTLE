║   █  Architectural Changes                                                   ║
║      ░ ■ Implemented state validation in `PlayerStateData` and `BossStateData`║
║      ░   using property setters. This makes the data resources self-validating║
║      ░   and prevents invalid states (e.g., health > max_health).            ║
║      ░ ■ Created a formal `ComponentInterface` to act as a standardized      ║
║      ░   blueprint for all entity components, enforcing a consistent API.    ║
║      ░ ■ Refactored `GameManager` to use a `GameStateData` resource,         ║
║      ░   eliminating the "dual architecture" of stateful singletons. All     ║
║      ░   runtime state is now consistently managed through `Resource` objects.║
║      ░ ■ Replaced the JSON-based `Config.gd` system with a type-safe,        ║
║      ░   `Resource`-based system (`CombatConfig.tres` and `CombatDB.gd`).    ║
║      ░   This provides compile-time safety against typos and enables direct  ║
║      ░   gameplay value tuning in the Godot editor's Inspector.              ║
║      ░ ■ Refactored the Player's state machine to load its state scripts at  ║
║      ░   runtime in `_ready()` instead of using `preload()`. This breaks a   ║
║      ░   brittle parse-time dependency cycle, making the game's startup      ║
║      ░   sequence significantly more robust.                                 ║
║      ░ ■ Further refined the `src/core` directory structure, creating new    ║
║      ░   subdirectories for typed configs and events (`data/config`, `events/typed_events`).║
║      ░ ■ Standardized script filenames to snake_case (e.g., `Config.gd` ->   ║
║      ░   `config.gd`) for project-wide consistency.                          ║
║      ░ ■ Reorganized the monolithic `src` directory into purpose-driven      ║
║      ░   subdirectories (`building`, `data`, `systems`, `util`, etc.) to     ║
║      ░   improve project modularity and scalability.                         ║
║                                                                              ║
║   █  Changed                                                                 ║
║      ░ ■ Refactored `HealthComponent` to initialize the new self-validating  ║
║      ░   data resources, simplifying its internal logic.                     ║
║      ░ ■ Refactored `CombatComponent` and `InputComponent` to extend the new ║
║      ░   `ComponentInterface`, standardizing the entire component architecture.║
║      ░ ■ Updated `player.gd` to use the standardized `setup` and `teardown`  ║
║      ░   methods for all its components.                                     ║
║      ░ ■ Refactored `HealthComponent` to extend the new `ComponentInterface` ║
║      ░   and use a more robust `is_in_group` check for its setup logic.      ║
║      ░ ■ Reorganized `AssetPaths.gd` by feature/system for improved clarity. ║
║      ░ ■ Added a validation system to `AssetPaths.gd` that checks for missing║
║      ░   files at startup, preventing runtime "file not found" errors.       ║
║      ░ ■ Added validation to `Settings.gd` property setters to clamp audio   ║
║      ░   volume values, making the system more robust against invalid data.  ║
║                                                                              ║
║   █  Added                                                                   ║
║      ░ ■ Added placeholder `README.md` and `DEPRECATION.md` files to `core`, ║
║      ░   `entities`, and `docs` to establish a documentation framework.      ║
║                                                                              ║
║   █  Documentation                                                           ║
║      ░ ■ Improved header comments in `Constants.gd` and `PhysicsLayers.gd`   ║
║      ░   to clarify their intended purpose and prevent architectural drift.  ║
║      ░ ■ Completed Sprint 0 architectural audit.                             ║
║      ░ ■ Added `docs/sprint_0_audit` directory to house analysis files.      ║
║      ░ ■ Generated audit reports for singletons, event usage, and config usage.║
║      ░ ■ Added `ADR-001` to formally document the existing Service Locator pattern.║
║      ░ ■ Added `FSM-001` to diagram the Player and Boss state machines.      ║
║      ░ ■ Created placeholder documents for testing (`TEST-*`) and refactoring║
║      ░   principles (`ARCH-*`) to guide future sprints.                      ║
║                                                                              ║
║   █  Fixed                                                                   ║
║      ░ ■ Added missing `max_health` property to `BossStateData` to resolve a ║
║      ░   crash when the boss took damage.                                    ║
║      ░ ■ Resolved a crash caused by using the non-existent `has()` method in ║
║      ░   `HealthComponent`; replaced with a more robust `is_in_group()` check.║
║      ░ ■ Corrected invalid GDScript 4 dictionary access syntax in `player.gd`.║
║      ░ ■ Removed the invalid `override` keyword from `HealthComponent`, which ║
║      ░   was causing a critical parse error.                                 ║
║      ░ ■ Corrected the argument order in `HealthComponent.setup` calls to    ║
║      ░   match the newly defined `ComponentInterface` contract.              ║
║      ░ ■ Resolved a parse-time dependency error by ensuring `GameStateData`  ║
║      ░   is loaded at runtime in `GameManager`, preventing a startup crash.  ║
║      ░ ■ Resolved a cascade of parse errors by correcting the implementation ║
║      ░   of the new `CombatConfig` resource and refactoring dependent scripts.║
║      ░ ■ Corrected multiple typos and syntax errors in player state scripts  ║
║      ░   (`state_attack.gd`, `state_hurt.gd`, `state_wall_slide.gd`) that    ║
║      ░   were causing crashes during gameplay.                               ║
║      ░ ■ Updated all autoload paths in `project.godot` to reflect the new    ║
║      ░   `core` directory structure, resolving all 'File not found' errors.  ║
║                                                                              ║
