   █  Architectural Changes                                                   
      ░ ■ Hardened the `Sequencer` to return a `SequenceHandle`, allowing      
      ░   cinematic sequences to be safely cancelled to prevent state bugs.   
      ░ ■ Hardened the `ObjectPool` by replacing fragile, name-based node      
      ░   lookups with direct references, making the system more robust.      
      ░ ■ Decoupled game logic from screen resolution by creating a `GridUtils`
      ░   singleton to handle conversions between tile and world coordinates.
      ░ ■ Implemented a `CameraManager` to dynamically fit the camera to the
      ░   arena's logical size, enabling support for non-square aspect ratios.
      ░ ■ Enhanced the `TerrainBuilder` to procedurally fill the entire camera
      ░   viewport with background tiles, creating a seamless play area.
                                                                              
   █  Fixed                                                                   
      ░ ■ Resolved a potential memory leak in the `EventBus` by implementing   
      ░   a self-cleaning mechanism that automatically prunes dead            
      ░   subscriptions during the `emit` cycle.                              
      ░ ■ Corrected several `async`/`await` errors in the `Sequencer` and its  
      ░   new `CallableStep` to ensure it can reliably execute async functions.


   █  Changed
      ░ ■ Project display settings updated to a 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080).
      ░ ■ Refactored procedural UI menus to use container nodes for better
      ░   resizing, though minor alignment issues remain (see BUGS.txt).

   █  Architectural Changes                                                   
      ░ ■ Created a data-driven `AttackPattern` resource, allowing boss      
      ░   attack properties (timing, cooldowns) to be designed and tuned     
      ░   directly in the editor instead of being hard-coded.                 
      ░ ■ Implemented a new, reusable `TelegraphComponent` scene to provide    
      ░   consistent and clear visual warnings for all enemy attacks.         
                                                                              
   █  Changed                                                                 
      ░ ■ Refactored the `BaseBoss` and its state machine to be fully data-driven.
      ░   The `AttackState` now reads an `AttackPattern` resource to execute   
      ░   attacks, and the `IdleState` is responsible for selecting which      
      ░   pattern to use.                                                     


   █  Architectural Changes                                                   
      ░ ■ Decoupled game logic from screen resolution by creating a `GridUtils`
      ░   singleton to handle conversions between tile and world coordinates. 
      ░ ■ Implemented a `CameraManager` to support non-square aspect ratios.  
      ░ ■ Enhanced the `TerrainBuilder` to procedurally fill the entire camera
      ░   viewport with background tiles, creating a seamless play area.      
                                                                              
   █  Changed                                                                 
      ░ ■ Project's default display resolution updated from 1000x1000 to a     
      ░   pixel-perfect 1800x1000 widescreen aspect ratio.                    
      ░ ■ The Player's dash mechanic has been refined. All momentum is now     
      ░   cancelled at the end of a dash, providing a more precise "hard stop" 
      ░   feel and allowing for more controlled aerial maneuvers.             
                                                                              
   █  Fixed                                                                   
      ░ ■ Resolved a long-standing visual bug where debug collision shapes would
      ░   be incorrectly culled at the viewport edges by correcting the engine's
      ░   update order in the `game.gd` scene.                                
      ░ ■ Replaced all `ColorRect` nodes used for in-world visuals with        
      ░   `Polygon2D` nodes to prevent potential rendering conflicts.         
      ░ ■ Fixed a critical race condition where killing the boss would not trigger
      ░   the victory screen by moving the logic to the global `EventBus`.    
      ░ ■ Addressed several minor UI layout bugs for better consistency.      



         █  Added                                                                   
      ░ ■ Implemented a dynamic, three-phase boss fight. The boss now becomes
      ░   more aggressive as its health decreases, using faster cooldowns and
      ░   more complex attack patterns in later phases.                       
      ░ ■ Added phase indicator icons to the Game HUD that update in real-time
      ░   to visually represent the boss's current phase.                      
      ░ ■ Created a templated boss death sequence using the `Sequencer`. This 
      ░   creates a cinematic pause after defeating the boss before the       
      ░   victory screen appears.                                             
                                                                              
   █  Changed                                                                 
      ░ ■ The boss's `HealthComponent` can now detect when health crosses      
      ░   pre-defined thresholds and emit a signal, enabling phase transitions.
      ░ ■ The `GameHUD`'s player health bar now correctly uses a color from the
      ░   global `Palette` for visual consistency.                            
                                                                              
   █  Fixed                                                                   
      ░ ■ Resolved a "zombie attack" bug where the boss could still fire       
      ░   projectiles after dying by adding an `_is_dead` state flag.         
      ░ ■ Fixed a bug where active projectiles would persist across scene      
      ░   transitions by adding a global reset function to the `ObjectPool`.  
      ░ ■ Corrected the phase indicator UI to deplete from right-to-left.
