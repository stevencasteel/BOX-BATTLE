refactor(entity): Remove hybrid component access pattern

Replaced all direct component variable access (e.g., `owner.health_component`) with the standardized `get_component(ComponentType)` method across the entire codebase.

This change fully commits to a scalable, component-based architecture by:
- Removing direct component variables from `BaseEntity`.
- Updating all entity classes (`Player`, `BaseBoss`, `Turret`), their states, and their components to use the new access pattern.
- Modifying the debug overlay, fx playground, and loading screen to conform to the new API.
- Updating all relevant unit and integration tests to use `get_component`, and adapting the `MockEntity` to maintain test compatibility.

This architectural improvement decouples components from their owners, simplifies adding new components via archetypes, and establishes a single, consistent API for inter-component communication.



fix(player): Resolve player healing and resource accrual bugs

The player healing system was non-functional due to a chain of three distinct issues, which have now been resolved.

- A race condition between the jump and heal actions caused the player to jump instead of healing. This was resolved by moving the heal-check logic from the global `PlayerAbilityComponent` into the `state_move` script, ensuring it has priority over the jump action when grounded.

- The `HealingTimer`'s `timeout` signal was not connected, preventing the heal from finalizing. The connection has been added in `player.gd`.

- Melee attacks did not grant determination for heal charges. The melee damage logic was improperly located in `player.gd`. It has been moved to a new `trigger_melee_attack` method in `CombatComponent`, which now correctly emits the `damage_dealt` signal that the `PlayerResourceComponent` listens for. This centralizes all player-initiated damage logic.




 refactor(projectiles): unify into BaseProjectile, restore player shot speed
- Added BaseProjectile.gd with shared pooling, movement, and collision logic
- Updated PlayerShot, BossShot, TurretShot, and HomingBossShot to extend it
- Fixed parent calls to use `super` and removed duplicate code
- Restored PlayerShot speed (1000) via default_speed set in activate()
- Cleaned up HomingBossShot (lifetime timer, tween cleanup)      


Refactor: Implement scalable component caching in BaseEntity.
- Replaced the if/elif chain in BaseEntity with a dictionary-based system for caching components.
- Added a generic `get_component(type)` method for future-proof component retrieval.
- Kept legacy public component variables for backward compatibility during the transition.
- Removed memory leak test files to clean up the test suite.




   CI & TOOLING: AUTOMATED CODE QUALITY & FORMATTING
   Established a comprehensive code quality pipeline by integrating an
   automated code formatter and a custom shader linter, ensuring project-wide
   consistency and adherence to best practices.
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   █  CI & Tooling
      ░ ■ Integrated the `gdformat` tool to automatically format all `.gd`
      ░   scripts according to the official Godot style guide. The entire
      ░   codebase has been formatted.
      ░ ■ Configured VS Code to automatically format GDScript files on save,
      ░   streamlining the development workflow and guaranteeing consistency.
      ░ ■ Created a new command-line shader linter (`lint_shaders.gd`) to
      ░   enforce critical rules for mobile renderer stability, such as the
      ░   presence of `shader_type` and `: source_color` hints.





   TESTING & ARCHITECTURE: PURE UNIT TESTS
   Completed a major refactor of the unit test suite to enable true "pure"
   unit testing, fully decoupling components from global singletons. This
   enhances test reliability, speed, and architectural clarity.
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   █  Architectural Changes
      ░ ■ Implemented the "Fake Object" pattern by creating lightweight,
      ░   test-double implementations for core singletons (`FakeEventBus`,
      ░   `FakeObjectPool`, `FakeFXManager`) in a new `src/tests/fakes` directory.
      ░ ■ The `CombatComponent` was refactored to use duck typing for its
      ░   `_object_pool` dependency, removing a hard static type requirement
      ░   that created cyclic dependencies during testing.
   █  Testing
      ░ ■ Refactored all relevant unit tests (`test_health_component`,
      ░   `test_combat_component`, `test_player_resource_component`) to inject
      ░   these fake singletons instead of using the real autoloads.
      ░ ■ The tests now verify behavior (e.g., "was a method called?", "was an
      ░   event emitted?") by inspecting the state of the fakes, not by checking
      ░   the global state of the game.
   █  Fixed
      ░ ■ Resolved a series of complex script errors, including cyclic
      ░   dependencies and static type mismatches, that were preventing the
      ░   test suite from running cleanly.
      ░ ■ Fixed a timing-related bug in a `CombatComponent` test by making it
      ░   `async` to correctly handle a `call_deferred` operation.



   FX SYSTEM HARDENING & OPTIMIZATION
   Completed a major overhaul of the visual effects pipeline to improve
   robustness, stability, and performance, completing Phases 1 and 2 of the
   FX & Shader Refactor plan.
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   █  Architectural Changes
      ░ ■ Hardened the `FXComponent` to be architecturally sound. It now always
      ░   creates a unique, duplicated material instance for every effect it
      ░   plays, programmatically eliminating shared-state visual bugs.
      ░ ■ Implemented a new shader pre-warming system. The `FXManager` now has a
      ░   `prewarm_shaders_async` method, which is called by the `LoadingScreen`
      ░   to compile critical shaders at startup, eliminating first-use stutter.
      ░ ■ Upgraded `FXManager` to include an "effect coalescing" system. It can
      ░   now intelligently ignore duplicate effect requests on the same target
      ░   if they occur within a configurable time window, preventing "event storms."
      ░ ■ The `ShaderEffect` resource was enhanced with a new `coalesce_window`
      ░   property, making this performance-tuning behavior fully data-driven.
   █  Fixed
      ░ ■ Resolved a critical GDScript type-checking error in `LoadingScreen`
      ░   that occurred when using `const` arrays with typed resources.
   █  Changed
      ░ ■ The primary entity hit-flash effect has been updated to use the new
      ░   coalescing system, preventing visual noise from rapid, successive hits.
      

   SYSTEMS & NARRATIVE: DIALOGUE SYSTEM FOUNDATION
   Implemented the foundational, data-driven dialogue system, establishing the
   core architecture for all future narrative content.
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   █  Architectural Changes
      ░ ■ Created a new `DialogueManager` autoload singleton to act as the central
      ░   controller for all conversation logic, state, and UI lifecycle.
      ░ ■ Implemented a data-driven model using `DialogueData` and `DialogueLine`
      ░   custom resources, allowing for conversations to be authored entirely
      ░   in the Godot Inspector.
   █  Added
      ░ ■ Created a reusable `DialogueBox.tscn` UI scene responsible for the
      ░   visual presentation of dialogue text.
      ░ ■ Implemented a "typewriter" text reveal effect in the `DialogueBox`
      ░   using a Tween to animate the `visible_ratio` of a RichTextLabel.
      ░ ■ Added a temporary debug key (`I`) to the encounter scene to trigger
      ░   a test conversation for rapid iteration and verification.
   █  Fixed
      ░ ■ Hardened the `DialogueManager` to be lifecycle-aware; it now
      ░   automatically closes any active conversation when a scene transition
      ░   is initiated, preventing UI from persisting across scenes.

   GAME FEEL: ENTITY DISSOLVE EFFECT
   Implemented a data-driven, procedural dissolve shader effect that is now
   triggered by all entities (Player, Boss, Turret) upon death, providing
   consistent and satisfying visual feedback for combat resolution.
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   █  Added
      ░ ■ Created a new reusable, procedural dissolve shader (`dissolve.gdshader`)
      ░   that uses cellular noise for a stylized, blocky disintegration.
      ░ ■ Created a `dissolve_effect.tres` ShaderEffect resource to make the
      ░   effect configurable and data-driven.
      ░ ■ The `fx_playground` tool was updated to support testing and rapid
      ░   iteration of the new dissolve effect in isolation.
   █  Architectural Changes
      ░ ■ Enhanced the `FXComponent` to allow its `play_effect` method to be
      ░   awaited, enabling robust, timed death sequences.
      ░ ■ The `FXComponent` was also hardened to prevent it from restoring an
      ░   entity's original material if the entity is queued for deletion,
      ░   resolving a critical visual bug where dying entities would reappear.
   █  Fixed
      ░ ■ Resolved a complex race condition where the Boss could continue to
      ░   attack after death by ensuring its state machine and timers are
      ░   immediately torn down in its `_die()` method.

║  █  Architectural Changes                                                    ║
║     ░ ■ Implemented the Entity Archetype pattern. Entities are now built     ║
║     ░   at runtime based on a new `EntityArchetype.tres` resource, which     ║
║     ░   defines an entity's composition by listing its component scenes.     ║
║     ░ ■ Created a new generic `BaseEntity.gd` class that reads an archetype, ║
║     ░   instantiates all components, and caches typed references, serving as ║
║     ░   a Composition Root and Facade for all entities.                      ║
║     ░ ■ Implemented a robust Three-Phase Initialization pattern (Construct,  ║
║     ░   Inject, Setup) to resolve complex dependency ordering issues between ║
║     ░   entities and their components, particularly for `@onready` variables.║
║     ░ ■ Created a new `FXComponent` to be the sole manager of all entity-    ║
║     ░   specific visual effects, fully decoupling visual feedback from game  ║
║     ░   logic components like `HealthComponent`.                             ║
║  █  Refactored                                                               ║
║     ░ ■ Migrated the `Player` and its components to the new archetype system.║
║     ░   The `player.tscn` scene has been drastically simplified, with its    ║
║     ░   structure now defined in `player_archetype.tres`.                    ║
║     ░ ■ All individual component `.gd` scripts have been converted to reusable║
║     ░   `.tscn` files to support the new archetype system.                   ║
║  █  Fixed                                                                    ║
║     ░ ■ Resolved a persistent, silent failure with shader effects. The complex║
║     ░   `Tween`-based animation was replaced with a simpler, more reliable   ║
║     ░   `Timer`-based approach within the `FXComponent`, resulting in a      ║
║     ░   functional hit-flash effect.                                         ║
║     ░ ■ Eliminated all parse-order errors related to `BaseEntity` by correctly║
║     ░   registering it as a `class_name` and preloading it.                  ║
║     ░ ■ Fixed a resource UID conflict in `player.tscn` that was preventing the║
║     ░   scene from loading correctly.                                        ║
║                                                                              ║

║     ░   `RefCounted` to enforce explicit memory management.                  ║
║     ░ ■ Upgraded `BaseStateMachine` to manually free its state objects during║
║     ░   `teardown()`, breaking a critical cyclic reference that was causing  ║
║     ░   the memory leak.                                                     ║

║     ░ ■ Resolved a null reference crash in `PlayerPhysicsComponent` that     ║
║     ░   occurred when the player was freed mid-physics-frame after dying.    ║
║     ░ ■ Eliminated all `ObjectDB instances leaked at exit` warnings and their║

║      ░   resources, fully decoupling states from specific attack types.      ║
║      ░ ■ `StateBossAttack` is now a generic executor that reads attack data  ║
║      ░   from `AttackPattern` resources, enabling designers to create new    ║
║      ░   attacks without modifying state machine code.                       ║
║      ░ ■ Refactored the invincibility system into a centralized, token-based ║
║      ░   model within `HealthComponent`, making it reusable for any entity.  ║
║      ░ ■ Standardized all entities (`Player`, `BaseBoss`, `Turret`) to use a ║
║      ░   public `entity_data` property for architectural consistency.        ║
║   █  Added                                                                   ║
║      ░ ■ Created a skeleton for a new, complex attack (`HomingOmniBurstLogic`)║
║      ░   to serve as a template and proof-of-concept for the new system.     ║
║      ░ ■ Upgraded the `DebugOverlay` into a multi-target "Entity Inspector"  ║
║      ░   that can cycle through all player and enemy nodes in the scene.     ║
║      ░ ■ Added new input actions (`debug_toggle_overlay`, `debug_cycle_target`)║
║      ░   mapped to `Y` and `U` for controlling the new inspector.            ║
║   █  Removed                                                                 ║
║      ░ ■ The `ArmorComponent` is now obsolete and has been removed, its      ║
║      ░   functionality absorbed by the new token-based invincibility system. ║
║      ░ ■ Legacy invincibility flags (`is_invincible`, `is_dash_invincible`)  ║
║      ░   have been removed from all entity data resources.                   ║
║   █  Fixed                                                                   ║
║      ░ ■ Resolved a critical bug where the boss lunge attack would fail due  ║
║      ░   to an incomplete resource refactor. The lunge and its correct       ║
║      ░   directional telegraph are now fully functional.                     ║
║      ░ ■ Fixed a "stale reference" crash in the debug overlay that occurred  ║
║      ░   when cycling targets after an entity had been destroyed.            ║
║      ░ ■ Ensured all spawned minions (`Turret`) are given unique, sequential ║
║      ░   names (e.g., `Turret_1`, `Turret_2`) for easier debugging.          ║
║                                                                              ║
