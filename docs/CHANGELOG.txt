   ENTITY ARCHITECTURE OVERHAUL (ENTITY ARCHETYPE PATTERN)                     
   Completed a full-scale refactor of the entity system to a data-driven,     
   archetype-based architecture. This foundational change enhances modularity, 
   improves adherence to SOLID principles, and establishes a robust, future-   
   proof pipeline for managing complex entities and their visual effects.      
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────    
   █  Architectural Changes                                                    
      ░ ■ Implemented the Entity Archetype pattern. Entities are now built 
      ░   at runtime based on a new `EntityArchetype.tres` resource, which     
      ░   defines an entity's composition by listing its component scenes.     
      ░ ■ Created a new generic `BaseEntity.gd` class that reads an archetype, 
      ░   instantiates all components, and caches typed references, serving as 
      ░   a Composition Root and Facade for all entities.                      
      ░ ■ Implemented a robust Three-Phase Initialization pattern (Construct,
      ░   Inject, Setup) to resolve complex dependency ordering issues between 
      ░   entities and their components, particularly for `@onready` variables.
      ░ ■ Created a new `FXComponent` to be the sole manager of all entity-    
      ░   specific visual effects, fully decoupling visual feedback from game  
      ░   logic components like `HealthComponent`.                             
   █  Refactored                                                               
      ░ ■ Migrated the `Player` and its components to the new archetype system.
      ░   The `player.tscn` scene has been drastically simplified, with its     
      ░   structure now defined in `player_archetype.tres`.                    
      ░ ■ All individual component `.gd` scripts have been converted to reusable
      ░   `.tscn` files to support the new archetype system.                   
   █  Fixed                                                                    
      ░ ■ Resolved a persistent, silent failure with shader effects. The complex
      ░   `Tween`-based animation was replaced with a simpler, more reliable  
      ░   `Timer`-based approach within the `FXComponent`, resulting in a      
      ░   functional hit-flash effect.                                         
      ░ ■ Eliminated all parse-order errors related to `BaseEntity` by correctly
      ░   registering it as a `class_name` and preloading it.                  
      ░ ■ Fixed a resource UID conflict in `player.tscn` that was preventing the
      ░   scene from loading correctly.




   MEMORY MANAGEMENT & CRITICAL BUG FIXES                                      
   Resolved a critical crash-on-death and a major memory leak on scene exit    
   by hardening entity lifecycle management and teardown patterns.             
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────    
   █  Architectural Changes                                                    
      ░ ■ Refactored the `BaseState` class to extend `Object` instead of       
      ░   `RefCounted` to enforce explicit memory management.                  
      ░ ■ Upgraded `BaseStateMachine` to manually free its state objects during
      ░   `teardown()`, breaking a critical cyclic reference that was causing  
      ░   the memory leak.                                                     
   █  Fixed                                                                    
      ░ ■ Resolved a null reference crash in `PlayerPhysicsComponent` that     
      ░   occurred when the player was freed mid-physics-frame after dying.    
      ░ ■ Eliminated all `ObjectDB instances leaked at exit` warnings and their
      ░   associated RID leaks by fixing the state machine's memory management.
   █  Removed                                                                  
      ░ ■ Deleted the unused `vfx_manager.gd` to eliminate ambiguity with the  
      ░   primary `FXManager` singleton.

║     ░ ■ Implemented a "VFX Cookbook" pattern by creating a `VFXEffect`       ║
║     ░   Resource. This allows designers to define particle effects as data assets.║
║     ░ ■ Upgraded `FXManager` with a `play_vfx()` method to serve as the      ║
║     ░   single, decoupled API for triggering all visual effects.             ║
║     ░ ■ Refactored the `ObjectPool` to use a canonical, robust pattern that  ║
║     ░   eliminates all parenting-related errors and physics race conditions. ║
║  █  Added                                                                    ║
║     ░ ■ Created a new reusable, pooled `hit_spark.tscn` particle effect.     ║
║     ░ ■ The `DamageInfo` resource was expanded to include `impact_position`  ║
║     ░   and `impact_normal` to provide VFX with necessary spawn data.        ║
║  █  Fixed                                                                    ║
║     ░ ■ Resolved a critical crash caused by incorrect state change calls in  ║
║     ░   the `PlayerPhysicsComponent` during contact damage checks.           ║
║     ░ ■ Eliminated a visual bug where pooled projectiles would not disappear ║
║     ░   after being returned to the pool by adding `visible = false` to      ║
║     ░   their `deactivate()` methods.                                        ║

║     ░   method to ensure robust, explicit cleanup before scene changes.      ║
║     ░ ■ Upgraded `SceneManager` to call `scene_exiting()` on the active scene,║
║     ░   allowing nodes like Player and Boss to properly run their `teardown()` logic.║
║     ░ ■ Created a central `Interfaces.gd` autoload to manage the preloading of║

║     ░   player damage, phase transitions, and boss death.                    ║
║     ░ ■ Implemented a hierarchical hit-stop system to punctuate pivotal moments:║
║     ░   - A micro-pause rewards the player for landing high-risk, close-range attacks.║
║     ░   - A brief pause occurs when the player takes damage, emphasizing impact.║

║     ░ ■ Created a new `CameraShaker` component that uses Perlin noise to     ║
║     ░   procedurally generate smooth, non-repeating camera shake effects.    ║
║     ░ ■ Implemented a new `ScreenShakeEffect` Resource type, allowing for    ║
║     ░   the creation of reusable, designer-tunable shake assets that define  ║
║     ░   amplitude, frequency, and duration.                                  ║
║     ░ ■ Upgraded `FXManager` to be the central API for requesting all screen ║
║     ░   effects, decoupling gameplay logic from the camera implementation.   ║
║  █  Added                                                                    ║
║     ░ ■ Integrated screen shake effects for several key gameplay events:     ║
║     ░   - A high-impact shake on boss intro.                                 ║
║     ░   - A jarring shake when the player takes damage.                      ║
║     ░   - A substantial shake for boss phase transitions.                    ║

║      ░ ■ Refactored the entire boss attack system to use the Strategy Pattern.║
║      ░   Attack execution is now encapsulated in modular `AttackLogic`       ║
║      ░   resources, fully decoupling states from specific attack types.      ║
║      ░ ■ `StateBossAttack` is now a generic executor that reads attack data  ║
║      ░   from `AttackPattern` resources, enabling designers to create new    ║
║      ░   attacks without modifying state machine code.                       ║
║      ░ ■ Refactored the invincibility system into a centralized, token-based ║
║      ░   model within `HealthComponent`, making it reusable for any entity.  ║
║      ░ ■ Standardized all entities (`Player`, `BaseBoss`, `Turret`) to use a ║
║      ░   public `entity_data` property for architectural consistency.        ║
║   █  Added                                                                   ║
║      ░ ■ Created a skeleton for a new, complex attack (`HomingOmniBurstLogic`)║
║      ░   to serve as a template and proof-of-concept for the new system.     ║
║      ░ ■ Upgraded the `DebugOverlay` into a multi-target "Entity Inspector"  ║
║      ░   that can cycle through all player and enemy nodes in the scene.     ║
║      ░ ■ Added new input actions (`debug_toggle_overlay`, `debug_cycle_target`)║
║      ░   mapped to `Y` and `U` for controlling the new inspector.            ║
║   █  Removed                                                                 ║
║      ░ ■ The `ArmorComponent` is now obsolete and has been removed, its      ║
║      ░   functionality absorbed by the new token-based invincibility system. ║
║      ░ ■ Legacy invincibility flags (`is_invincible`, `is_dash_invincible`)  ║
║      ░   have been removed from all entity data resources.                   ║
║   █  Fixed                                                                   ║
║      ░ ■ Resolved a critical bug where the boss lunge attack would fail due  ║
║      ░   to an incomplete resource refactor. The lunge and its correct       ║
║      ░   directional telegraph are now fully functional.                     ║
║      ░ ■ Fixed a "stale reference" crash in the debug overlay that occurred  ║
║      ░   when cycling targets after an entity had been destroyed.            ║
║      ░ ■ Ensured all spawned minions (`Turret`) are given unique, sequential ║
║      ░   names (e.g., `Turret_1`, `Turret_2`) for easier debugging.          ║
║                                                                              ║
