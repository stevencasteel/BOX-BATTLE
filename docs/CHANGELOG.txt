║      ░ ■ Overhauled level loading to use an asynchronous, batch-based system ║
║      ░   in `ArenaBuilder`, eliminating stuttering when entering the arena.  ║
║      ░ ■ Refactored Player and Boss death logic to be signal-based,          ║

║      ░ ■ Corrected implementation of hazard tiles to ensure contact damage.  ║
║      ░ ■ Implemented a robust, timer-based hit flash after debugging issues with Tween.║
║      ░ ■ Fixed a logic bug where player death incorrectly led to the Victory screen.║
║      ░ ■ Corrected a bug where the boss's sprite would flip independently    ║
║      ░   of its collision shape, causing a visual desync.                    ║
║      ░ ■ Resolved a critical startup crash caused by improper scene changing.║
║      ░ ■ Restored ability to drop through one-way platforms.                 ║
║      ░ ■ Standard melee attacks (forward/up) now correctly destroy enemy     ║
║      ░   projectiles.                                                        ║
