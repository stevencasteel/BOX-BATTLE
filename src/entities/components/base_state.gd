# src/entities/components/base_state.gd
## The abstract base class for all entity states.
##
## Defines the lifecycle methods that every state must implement. States are
## responsible for handling logic for a specific entity behavior (e.g., moving,
## attacking, dashing).

# --- Virtual Lifecycle Methods ---

## Called once when the state machine enters this state.

## Called during the `_unhandled_input` cycle. Used for immediate input reactions.
