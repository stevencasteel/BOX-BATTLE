# Box Battle

A Mega Man & Hollow Knight inspired arena-style battle game built in Godot.

## Hello World! 👋

Welcome to Box Battle - an action-packed arena battle game that combines the fast-paced combat of Mega Man with the atmospheric design of Hollow Knight.

## 🎮 About

This project is being developed using a code-first approach with help from AI assistants (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 4.0, and ChatGPT). The game features:

- **State machine-based architecture** for clean, maintainable code
- **Professional singleton patterns** and constants instead of scattered booleans
- **Complete menu system** with title screen, options, controls, and sound settings
- **Responsive player movement** system (currently being fine-tuned)

## 🚀 Current Status

**Week 1 Complete!** ✅
- ✅ Title screen menu system working
- ✅ Player movement mostly implemented
- ✅ Major refactor completed (moved from booleans to state machines)
- ✅ Audio system with menu sound effects
- ✅ Custom UI components and cursor management

**Next Up:**
- Fine-tuning player movement mechanics
- Implementing combat system
- Arena design and enemy AI
