║   █  Tough but Fair: The game is designed to be challenging. Player failure  ║
║      should feel like a learning opportunity, not a punishment.              ║
║                                                                              ║
║   █  Player Expression: The player is given a rich and responsive moveset.   ║
║      Mastery of these movement options is the key to success.                ║
║                                                                              ║
║   █  Thematic Mechanics: Gameplay systems are tied to narrative concepts.    ║
║      Aggression is rewarded with the ability to heal via "Determination."    ║
║                                                                              ║
║   █  Minimalist Clarity: UI and gameplay indicators provide necessary info   ║
║      without cluttering the screen.                                          ║

║   █  Human-AI Collaborative Design: The level design process is a partnership║
║      between a human and an AI, facilitated by the human-readable coordinate ║

║      A rich platforming system designed for precision and control.           ║
║      ░ ■ Coyote Time: Player can jump for a fraction of a second after       ║
║      ░   walking off a ledge.                                                ║
║      ░ ■ Jump Buffering: Jump inputs are remembered briefly, executing upon  ║
║      ░   landing.                                                            ║
║      ░ ■ Dashing: A quick, fixed-distance burst of speed in 8 directions.   ║
║      ░ ■ Wall-Sliding & Wall-Jumping: Allows for vertical traversal.        ║
║      ░ ■ Drop-Through Platforms: Player can press Down + Jump to fall       ║
║      ░   through one-way platforms.                                          ║

║      ░ ■ Primary Attack (Melee): A quick, short-range attack.               ║
║      ░ ■ Secondary Attack (Charged Shot): Holding attack charges a powerful, ║
║      ░   long-range projectile.                                              ║
║      ░ ■ Charge Fizzle: Releasing the charge too early results in a fizzle.   ║
║      ░ ■ Pogo Attack: A downward melee allows bouncing off targets,          ║
║      ░   resetting aerial abilities.                                         ║
║      ░ ■ Hitbox/Hurtbox System: Precise collision system for dealing and     ║
║      ░   taking damage.                                                      ║

║   ▓  Health and Healing: The Determination System                            ║
║      ░  Philosophy: Healing is earned directly through successful combat,    ║
║      ░  pushing an offensive playstyle.                                       ║
║      ░  Mechanic: Dealing damage fills a `determination_counter` to earn a   ║
║      ░  `healing_charge`. A charge can be consumed to heal, but this takes   ║
║      ░  time and leaves the player vulnerable.                                ║
║                                                                              ║

║      ░ ■ "Corner Armor" Health System: Boss health is represented by three   ║
║      ░   destructible corner plates. Each destroyed plate triggers a new      ║
║      ░   phase with increased difficulty.                                     ║
║      ░ ■ Pattern-Based AI: Bosses follow strict, learnable attack patterns.   ║
║                                                                              ║
