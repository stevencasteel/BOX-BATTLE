║   █  Sublime Movement by Default: The player is given a complete,            ║
║      perfected, and expressive moveset from the very beginning. There is no  ║
║      gating of core movement abilities behind progression. The joy of the    ║
║      game comes from mastering these tools, not from unlocking them.         ║
║                                                                              ║
║   █  Arcade Game as a Boss: Each boss battle is a unique mechanical          ║
║      challenge inspired by a classic arcade game loop (e.g., Tempest,        ║
║      Centipede). The player's sublime moveset is the constant tool used to   ║
║      solve these varied combat puzzles.                                      ║
║                                                                              ║
║   █  Tough but Fair: The game is designed to be challenging. Player failure  ║
║      should feel like a learning opportunity, not a punishment.              ║
║                                                                              ║
║   █  Human-AI Collaborative Design: The level design process is a partnership║
║      between a human and an AI, facilitated by the human-readable coordinate ║
║      legend in level layout files.                                           ║

║   ▓  Advanced Movement Techniques (To Be Implemented)                        ║
║      ░ ■ Corner Correction: The game engine will subtly nudge the player up  ║
║      ░   and over sharp corners to prevent frustrating "bonks."              ║
║      ░ ■ Dash-Jump Cancel: Allows the player to interrupt a dash with a jump,║
║      ░   preserving some momentum for advanced precision movement.           ║
║      ░ ■ Fast-Fall: Holding 'Down' in the air increases gravity, giving the  ║
║      ░   player more control over their airtime.                             ║

║      ░  MECHANIC: Platforms appear/disappear on a musical beat. Player can   ║
