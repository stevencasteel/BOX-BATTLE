║      ░  pressing Down + Jump. The code for this was not implemented in the   ║

║      ░  DETAILS: When the player jumps and moves horizontally against a      ║
║      ░  wall, their top corner can clip the bottom corner of a tile above    ║
║      ░  them, causing them to "bonk" their head and fall immediately. This   ║
║      ░  feels jarring and unfair. The cause is likely the perfectly          ║
║      ░  rectangular shape of the player's `CollisionShape2D`.                ║

║      ░  SOLUTION: Re-implemented the `_check_for_immediate_pogo()` physics   ║
║      ░  query to allow instant bounces on surfaces directly below the        ║

║      ░  SOLUTION: During the state machine refactor, the player's            ║
║      ░  `CharacterBody2D` `collision_mask` was changed to ignore the         ║
║      ░  "enemy" and "hazard" layers. The mask was updated in `player.tscn`   ║
║      ░  to correctly detect these layers again, allowing the existing        ║
