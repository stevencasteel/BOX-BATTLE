║   ▒  [BUG-001] Player can get stuck on tile corners when jumping.            ║
║      ░  FOUND: 2025-08-05                                                    ║

║      ░  DETAILS: When the player jumps and moves horizontally against a      ║
║      ░  wall, their top corner can clip the bottom corner of a tile above    ║
║      ░  them, causing them to "bonk" their head and fall immediately. This   ║
║      ░  feels jarring and unfair. The cause is likely the perfectly          ║
║      ░  rectangular shape of the player's `CollisionShape2D`.                ║
║                                                                              ║

║      ░  FOUND: 2025-08-06                                                    ║

║      ░  DETAILS: After implementing the pre-building system, the major       ║
║      ░  load-in stutter is gone. However, a very minor frame drop may still  ║
║      ░  be present within the first second. This could be due to late shader ║

║      ░  SOLUTION: The `game.gd` script was made robust to handle both        ║
║      ░  initial loads (using the pre-built level from `GameManager`) and     ║
║      ░  reloads (by calling `ArenaBuilder.build_level()` as a fallback).     ║
║                                                                              ║

║      ░  SOLUTION: The `_on_hitbox_area_entered` function logic was           ║
║      ░  corrected to handle non-pogo attack collisions with projectiles,     ║
║      ░  allowing forward and upward swings to destroy them.                  ║
║                                                                              ║

║      ░  SOLUTION: Re-implemented the Down+Jump logic in the player's         ║
║      ░  `state_move` function. Corrected the platform's collision shape      ║
║      ░  position and group assignment in `game.gd`.                          ║
║                                                                              ║

║      ░  SOLUTION: Re-implemented the `_check_for_immediate_pogo()` physics   ║
║      ░  query to allow instant bounces on surfaces directly below the        ║
║      ░  player. Updated the `_trigger_pogo()` function to correctly handle   ║
║      ░  bouncing on enemy projectiles in addition to standard enemies.       ║
║                                                                              ║

║      ░  SOLUTION: During the state machine refactor, the player's            ║
║      ░  `CharacterBody2D` `collision_mask` was changed to ignore the         ║
║      ░  "enemy" and "hazard" layers. The mask was updated in `player.tscn`   ║
║      ░  to correctly detect these layers again, allowing the existing        ║
║      ░  `_check_for_contact_damage()` function to work as intended.          ║
