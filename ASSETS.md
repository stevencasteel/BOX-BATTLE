## Style Guide
*This section defines the target aesthetic for the game.*

### Visual Style
- **Overall:** Clean, minimalist, and geometric. The focus is on clarity and readability over complex detail. The placeholder "box" aesthetic serves as a strong foundation.
- **Color Palette:** High-contrast colors. The player is a light color, enemies are warm colors (reds/oranges), and the environment is made of dark, cool colors. Projectiles are brightly colored to stand out.
- **Shape Language:** A strict adherence to square-based geometry. All characters, projectiles, and attacks should be based on squares of equal proportion. Rectangles are only permitted for static environmental elements like thin platforms. **No circles.**

### Audio Style
- **Music:** Chiptune-inspired, melodic tracks with a driving beat, reminiscent of classic 8-bit and 16-bit era action games. The music should be loopable and suitable for intense boss battles.
- **Sound Effects:** Crisp, digital, and impactful SFX. Sounds should be distinct and immediately recognizable to provide clear feedback for gameplay actions (e.g., the "pogo" sound should be distinct from the "jump" sound).
